# Upload files to a GitHub release [![GitHub Actions Workflow](https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action/workflows/PR%20Checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action/actions)

This action allows you to select which files to upload to the just-tagged release.
It runs on all operating systems types offered by GitHub.

## Input variables

You must provide:

- `repo_token`: Usually you'll want to set this to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.
- `file`: A local file to be uploaded as the asset.
- `tag`: The tag to upload into. If you want the current event's tag or branch name, use `${{ github.ref }}` (the `refs/tags/` and `refs/heads/` prefixes will be automatically stripped).

Optional Arguments

- `asset_name`: The name the file gets as an asset on a release. Use `$tag` to include the tag name. When not provided it will default to the filename.
                This is not used if `file_glob` is set to `true`.
- `file_glob`: If set to true, the file argument can be a glob pattern (`asset_name` is ignored in this case) (Default: `false`)
- `overwrite`: If an asset with the same name already exists, overwrite it (Default: `false`).
- `duplicated_error`: If an asset with the same name already exists, throw error (Default: `true`).
- `prerelease`: Mark the release as a pre-release (Default: `false`).
- `release_name`: Explicitly set a release name. (Defaults: implicitly same as `tag` via GitHub API).
- `body`: Content of the release text (Default: `""`).
- `repo_name`: Specify the name of the GitHub repository in which the GitHub release will be created, edited, and deleted. If the repository is other than the current, it is required to create a personal access token with `repo`, `user`, `admin:repo_hook` scopes to the foreign repository and add it as a secret. (Default: current repository).

## Output variables

- `browser_download_url`: The publicly available URL of the asset.

## Usage

This usage assumes you want to build on tag creations only.
This is a common use case as you will want to upload release binaries for your tags.

Simple example:

```yaml
name: Publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Publish binaries
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --release
    - name: Upload binaries to release
      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
      with:
        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        file: target/release/mything
        asset_name: mything
        tag: ${{ github.ref }}
        overwrite: true
        body: "This is my release text"
```

Complex example with more operating systems:

```yaml
name: Publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish for ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            artifact_name: mything
            asset_name: mything-linux-amd64
          - os: windows-latest
            artifact_name: mything.exe
            asset_name: mything-windows-amd64
          - os: macos-latest
            artifact_name: mything
            asset_name: mything-macos-amd64

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --release --locked
    - name: Upload binaries to release
      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
      with:
        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        file: target/release/${{ matrix.artifact_name }}
        asset_name: ${{ matrix.asset_name }}
        tag: ${{ github.ref }}
```

Example with `file_glob`:

```yaml
name: Publish
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Publish binaries
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --release
    - name: Upload binaries to release
      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
      with:
        repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        file: target/release/my*
        tag: ${{ github.ref }}
        overwrite: true
        file_glob: true
```

Example for creating a release in a foreign repository using `repo_name`:

```yaml
name: Publish

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Publish binaries
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --release
    - name: Upload binaries to release
      uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
      with:
        repo_name: owner/repository-name
        # A personal access token for the GitHub repository in which the release will be created and edited.
        # It is recommended to create the access token with the following scopes: `repo, user, admin:repo_hook`.
        repo_token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        file: target/release/mything
        asset_name: mything
        tag: ${{ github.ref }}
        overwrite: true
        body: "This is my release text"
```

## Releasing

To release this Action:

- Bump version in `package.json`
- Create `CHANGELOG.md` entry
- `npm run all`
- `git commit -am <version>`
- `git tag -sm <version> <version>`
- `git push --follow-tags`
- Go to https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action/releases and publish the new version
